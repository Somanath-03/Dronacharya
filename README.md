# Dronacharya\n Our drone utilized a unique X-frame relied on a central Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller which managed communication between all components - ESCs, Sensors, GPS, Companion Computer(RPi 5) and the RC receiver and was used to control flight paths, maintain stability, gather sensor data. 
For data transmission, We leveraged the Raspberry Pi 5's built-in Wi-Fi, to send information to a ground station via MAVProxy protocol. Finally, to the functionality, We spearheaded the development of a facial recognition interface using the Haarcascade algorithm and the LBPH Classifier to classify trained faces with CSRT Tracker to track the user-specified object in the frame and a user-friendly web interface using flask to display real-time data like video, speed, altitude, and more.
